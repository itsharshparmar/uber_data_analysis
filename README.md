# 🚗 Uber Ride Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Uber ride data to extract meaningful insights into ride patterns, user behavior, and usage trends. By exploring when, where, and why people use Uber, this project helps understand urban transportation patterns using real-world data.

The analysis addresses various questions using **Python**, **Pandas**, and data visualization libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The project includes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights based on **16 carefully selected questions**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and clean the Uber dataset for accurate analysis.
- Perform feature engineering (extracting day, hour, month, etc. from timestamps).
- Analyze ride behavior by time, location, purpose, and distance.
- Answer 16 practical business-driven questions using data.
- Present visual insights using clean and informative plots.
- Document the notebook clearly and upload it to GitHub for showcasing.
